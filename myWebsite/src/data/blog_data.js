This event is a play on words for Cinco de Mayo, which is a celebration of the Battle of Puebla.</p><p>It was on May 5, 1862 when Mexico’s army won over France during the Franco-Mexican War. The Mexican state of Puebla has much pride in this victory because of its location, however, this holiday is not celebrated widely in the rest of Mexico. Traditions can include parades, recreations of the battle, and other festivities, although for many this is any other day.</p><p>Our event included a salsa competition that members could enter to showcase their best salsa. We also had icebreakers with facts about Mexico that people might not know. Some examples below:</p><ul><li>Mexico Is Where You’ll Find The Oldest University In North America</li><li>Mexico Is Home To One Of The Six Cradles Of Civilization</li><li>Mexican Silver Pesos Were The First Global Currency</li><li>All Beaches In Mexico Are Public</li></ul><p>There is a common misconception about Mexican Independence Day and Cinco de Mayo. Mexican Independence Day is on Sept 16<sup>th</sup> and celebrates the anniversary of the revolutionary priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla’s famous “Grito de Dolores”. This was a declaration of war against the Spanish colonial government in 1810 and now marks the first day of Hispanic Heritage Month.</p><p>Many of our SHPE members have family from Mexico and therefore put more value on Mexican Independence Day, but Cinco de Mayo is still an expression of our heritage. When planning this event, we look for ways to share that heritage with others to raise awareness about Mexican history.</p><p><img src="https://assets.editorial.aetnd.com/uploads/2019/05/battle-of-puebla-gettyimages-feature-527771091.jpg?width=3840&height=1920&crop=3840%3A1920%2Csmart&quality=75&auto=webp" alt="How Cinco de Mayo Helped Prevent a Confederate Victory in the Civil War - HISTORY" width="100%"/></p><p>The background behind the holiday is very impactful in Mexican history. Benito Juárez was elected president of Mexico in 1861 but had to deal with the fallout of many poor financial decisions leftover by years of internal strife. France, Britain, and Spain came to Mexico to collect the debt Mexico owed them. While Britain and Spain were able to negotiate an agreement, France decided to seek even more and declared war to expand the French empire into Mexico.</p><p>The Battle of Puebla took place at Puebla de Los Angeles on May 5, 1862 and was between 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez and 2,000 loyal men under Juárez. The Mexican men were outnumbered and poorly supplied, while the French troops had heavy artillery. Despite all of these disadvantages for the Mexican side, they managed to defend Puebla and lost less than 100 of their men while the French lost almost 500.</p><p>Although this didn’t end the war or do much to dissuade the French, this victory was a symbol of hope and bolstered the resistance movement. France finally withdrew in 1867 after the United States was able to support Mexico following the United States Civil War.</p><p>Click <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/cinco-de-mayo">here</a> or <a href="https://www.history.com/news/cinco-de-mayo-battle-puebla-civil-war">here</a> for more information about Cinco de Mayo and the Battle of Puebla.</p>`,

Having the opportunity to lead an 18-person leadership team and welcoming 9 first-year students into our First-Year Program has taught me so much about leadership and my own self.</p><p>I've learned how important it is to advocate for others. As president, I get a lot of the credit for the chapter being successful or even because I oversee projects that our team executes. This really isn’t fair, because our team works so hard to execute their vision and it is critical to our success that they get the credit they deserve. Our team is strong and has proven that they are resilient problem-solvers that are passionate about our community.</p><p>I felt empowered in this role because for the first time, my identity matters in a professional setting. In SHPE, identity is critical to our success as an engineer, and we work to support Hispanics in STEM by connecting identity to our careers. Our national convention supports 10,000 students and recruiters through workshops and a career fair that hires Hispanics in engineering.</p><p>Moving forward, I will continue my legacy by upholding the core values of resilience, familia, education, and service. These are SHPE’s guiding values and are important to uphold in our day-to-day lives. I’ve learned the important of being resilient through our engineering education curriculum and the challenges that life throws. Throughout my time at OU I’ve been surrounded by my own familia that supports me and lifts me up in times of need. The alumni and professionals that come back and speak to us have demonstrated the importance of our education. The service to our community is critical to uplifting and inspiring others to continue our legacies and to support those around us.</p><p>I was surprised by our ability to bring change and leave an impact. As president, I’ve connected alumni back to our chapter, met with the deans to discuss student funding, represented Oklahoma at our national convention, and reached students that I never would have met otherwise. All of these opportunities have been part of my legacy as a student at OU and I am proud of the work I’ve accomplished.</p><p>My perception of being a leader changed because I really learned about team work. In engineering group projects you might have a small team that works on a very technical problem, but in SHPE our team is almost 30 people now and all of our problems are complex social issues. This has been a welcoming challenge for me to figure out management for and I am determined to continue this work after I graduate.</p><p>Thank you for the memories, everyone. I’ll miss you all as I begin the next step of my journey.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-595 size-full" src="https://cpnewkirk.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/4161a-signature.png" alt="" width="500" height="150" /></p><p>Christian Newkirk</p><p>President, 2022-2023</p>`,

First, the conversation started with a focus on Brazil. The previous president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, fled to the United States after the next president was elected and I was surprised to learn that he has an expired visa. I thought it was interesting when one of the speakers shared that the political unrest in Brazil did not develop overnight, but has been building since the mid-2010s. The people of Brazil were asking the military to through a coop when former president Bolsonaro lost his election. Thinking about the January 6th United States Capitol attack, it feels like a similar timeline.</p><p>Brazil experienced another political unrest event not too long ago. Former president Dilma Rousseff, the first female president in Brazil's history, was impeached in 2016, but what marks her impeachment different from the end of other political figures' terms is how she responded. Referencing my post on the Brazil Capitol Riot, we know that both former United States president Trump and Bolsonaro incited fear in their followers, leading to the attacks. Rousseff did not respond this way to her impeachment. Although there was much unrest, the political climate did not lead to an attack on the capital.</p><p>Next, the panel went into the cause of the current political crisis in Peru. Having Mexican heritage and growing up in Texas, my Latin American knowledge doesn't go very far beyond Mexico. Learning about Peru, I realized they have a similar history as the indigenous peoples of North America. When Spain colonized parts of South America, the Spanish elites benefited from taking advantage of the indigenous communities in the Andes. I was surprised by how similar our histories were and by how they affected the country over time.</p><p>Indigenismo is the movement in Latin America to advocate for their indigenous populations to have more power, however, their government began labeling the movement as terrorismo (terrorism). 2 million hectares of land was taken from haciendas (a large landed estate), but only 45 thousand have been returned to their communities. Conflict was on the rise from 1980-2000 and the government used extreme military tactics to eliminate the terrorists and any opposition that spoke out. Since then, the politics in Peru have been charged. I was shocked to discover this and had no idea that there was so much turmoil in Peru right now.</p><p>To learn more about the Peru political crisis, click <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-63971274">here</a>.</p>`,

    body: `<p><img src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4705866/National_Days_map2.jpg" alt="National_days_map2" width="100%" /></p><p>An Independence Day can be sacred to the citizens of a country. Independence represents freedom, government, and people.</p><p>The green countries in the image above celebrate a national independence day. Many of them were former European colonies and some in Eastern Europe became independent from the former Soviet Union. From this map, it is clear that European colonialism has impacted a major portion of our modern world. Although independence for the United States might be a centuries-old idea, in some places it is a much more present issue and holds much more personal meaning.</p><p>Not every celebration is just an independence day. France, for example, celebrates Bastille Day as their revolution. Modern revolutions only date back to the 1700s, with France, South Africa, Iran, and China being some key examples. The unification of a country is another common cause for these national holidays.</p><p>Some countries celebrate different days entirely. Thailand celebrates the king’s birthday, Spain celebrates Columbus Day, Portugal celebrates the death of a celebrated poet, and Greenland celebrates the longest day of the year. Each country has its own culture and values. National holidays are one way to see what is valued by a country but don’t always tell the full story. Columbus Day is controversial in Spain just as it is in the United States and isn’t reflective of national pride.</p><p>I feel inspired by how different groups of people can take the traumatic experience of colonialism and celebrate their ability to overcome that through revolution or their declaration of independence. Living in present-day America, I don't feel connected to our Independence Day beyond festivities and fireworks. It is fascinating to read about recent revolutions and fights for independence happing in the 21st century and see how it is impacting people today. Our ancestors fought for a brighter future in this country but our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world are fighting right now for freedom in territories across the world.</p><p>Something interesting that I found is that the United Kingdom and Denmark don’t have a national holiday like this. It's said that the United Kingdom doesn’t have one because it played the role of the colonizer in so many other countries. Something else that contributes to the lack of a holiday is that it isn’t a homogenous state like other countries might be. It is made up of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, four non-sovereign countries. This unification happened over many centuries, not in a quick revolution, making it difficult to make a holiday that the whole country could take pride in.</p><p>You can read more about how different countries celebrate independence <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/3/5867599/heres-a-map-of-other-countries-versions-of-4th-of-july">here</a>.</p>`,

(Photo by Sergio Lima / AFP) (Photo by SERGIO LIMA/AFP via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>The Brazilian government has experienced some trouble reminiscent of the January 6th United States Capitol attack. This parallels the political divide between the left and right parties in each respective country. Seeing these events happen multiple times within a few years of each other is very troubling and I feel this is evidence of a problem on the global stage.</p><p>Brazil recently had a presidential election in October of 2022. The two leading candidates were Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right incumbent, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is from the left wing and better known as Lula. Lula won this campaign on October 30th in a run-off election and was inaugurated on January 1st, 2023.</p><p>On January 8th, thousands of Bolsonaro's supporters stormed Brasília, the nation's capital, claiming the election was rigged. This included congress, the supreme court, and the presidential offices. Americans will feel all too familiar feelings reading about this because it is claimed that Bolsonaro incited the riots through social media and has been claiming that Brazilian elections could not be trusted for years.</p><p>Political parties are often blamed for this division and seen as the cause of the anger and aggression that results, however, I believe that the real source of these issues lies in leadership. During the riots in the United States and Brazil, the incumbent president was actively working to speak down on the government institutions in the country. As a student leader, I've learned that it is important to show that you trust the systems that you work in and that conveying the importance of what you do supports your team. Former United States president Donald Trump and Bolsonaro did not support their institutions of power and instead, framed themselves as the source of power in the country. Rather than building trust in their systems, they guided their constituents to trust only them.</p><p>I feel like this is not a good way to lead a country because it does not put constituents first. Overvaluing a single person takes away from the purpose of democracy and having elections. Even with my limited experience as a student leader, I have found that the team can accomplish much more if trust with the institution is built. When there is little trust in these systems, it leads to problems in communication, execution, and development that should support those you represent.</p><p class="ok_Wdg ch9NWA UPenfA RVfbug toHYKQ">By learning more about what is happening in Brazil, I learned that the issues we experience in the United States are present in many regions across the globe. It takes everyone from all backgrounds to work toward a brighter future for our planet. Although it is important to focus on domestic issues, I encourage everyone to research what is happening globally because everything impacts the world we live in.</p><p>Click <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-64206220">here</a> to learn more about the Brazil riots from BBC and click <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/world/americas/brazil-election-protests-bolsonaro.html">here</a> to learn more from New York Times.</p>`,

    <p>This year I serve as the president of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). I have learned so much in this role already and have faced many challenges leading such a diverse group of people. These challenges have helped me grow and learn more about myself and how to leverage my own experiences as a leader to advocate for those in my community.</p>
    <p>After our leadership and convention sponsorship application decisions were made, many of those not selected were distraught. This led to many of them coming to me to seek advice. Through this experience, I’ve also learned how to advocate for others during the selection process. One of our members was selected for a regional leadership position and I got to advocate on their behalf to the regional leadership team. It’s made me realize the power that leaders have in organizations, especially ones as diverse as SHPE.</p>
    <p>With each challenge comes the feeling that we could have done better as a team. This can hurt if I dwell on what could have been or compare ourselves to other organizations and chapters. I have learned to trust my own judgment when making decisions and that the way I manage my emotions reflects on my leadership team.</p>
    <p>The Hispanic community is not a monolith and has diversity in so many ways. Every member has a different identity that has to do with their ability to speak Spanish, their heritage, where they were born, the color of their skin, and so many other factors. As a leader, it is up to us to ensure every member feels welcome in our organization and is given the opportunity to leave an impact.</p>

    <p>Data is consuming the world as new technology becomes more prevalent. New advances allow for big data to be analyzed and give advantages to the data revolution, which is the wide availability of data. Businesses around the world use data to make informed decisions about their customer base, decide on a new direction to go with their product, and make predictions about their industry.</p>
    
    <p>With these new innovations come questions of ethics and privacy related to big data. Data can be mishandled and harm people around the globe. Although data may be seen as fact, it heavily impacts inequality on a new frontier.</p>
    
    <p>I feel like one way to mitigate this risk is by including countries from the global south in decisions impacting big data. Many of these countries do not have accurate data on their populations and are not using contemporary technology to reach a solution. I think engineers are well suited to be a part of teams that assist any country looking for better solutions to this. There is a careful balance though when it comes to offering help. Although I might think a country is not living up to its potential, there are cultural boundaries that need to be considered before discussing the future of a country.</p>
    
    <p>Although I have many concerns about the harm that big data can cause, I learned a lot about the good it can do as well. The United Nations has 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that aim to achieve zero extreme poverty and zero emissions by 2030. Previously hidden disparities can be shown using big data and have the potential to positively change the world. Among these goals, I found some specific ways that big data can support them. I had not thought of using big data in these ways before and thought that it was very thought-provoking.</p>
    
    <p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> SDG is to accomplish zero hunger. Big data can support this by analyzing crowdsourced data on food prices to monitor food security in real time. This is interesting because I hadn’t thought about the implications that online food prices have in relation to the physical location it comes from. Much of my everyday food comes from Walmart, which has consistent pricing, but the world does not experience food security as consistently.</p>
    
    <p>Gender equality, SDG 5, was not a result that I would initially have associated with big data. Looking at financial transactions across an economy can showcase the spending patterns that men and women show. This was interesting to me because I hadn’t thought about how this information could be useful before. Much of society pushes gendered roles onto us, but I hadn’t thought about how big data could be used to combat that or analyze trends in different regions of the world to determine where gender inequality might be more prevalent.</p>
    
    <p>Lastly, I found that sustainable cities and communities, SDG 11, can utilize satellites to track the amount of public land being encroached on by cities and industry. The Amazon Rainforest immediately comes to mind with the amount of lumber available and big businesses looking to take advantage of this resource. Although many privacy concerns need to be solved, this is a positive way that visual imaging satellites can be used.</p>
    
    <p>Many of these ways of using big data impressed me and inspire me to continue studying software engineering to support social development. This is a passion of mine that I have learned more about through this reading.</p>

    <p>Protests are occurring around the world against morality police to challenge Iran's Shia Muslim clerical establishment. This was triggered by the death of a Kurdish woman visiting the capital after she was arrested for allegedly violating the law that requires women to cover their hair with a hijab. This event has incited unrest amongst the people of Iran and has developed on the global stage, with many around the globe contributing to the discussion of these events on social media.</p>
    
    <p>I think that it is interesting how some of the themes we see manifest in civil unrest are present around the globe. For example, the murder of George Floyd in May of 2020 led to much unrest from the people of the United States, not unlike what is being seen in Iran today. Police brutality and institutional inequality are some themes that were given more visibility in the United States as a result and led to much division between the national government and groups of citizens. Having felt passionate about this cause myself, hearing about the Iran people experiencing this turmoil feels familiar. I feel their pain and will never fully understand the loss and despair that they must feel.</p>
    
    <p>There is much debate on the amount of force being used against these protesters. It is being reported that the police are firing live rounds into the crown, however, the government is denying this. Allegedly the commander of the riot police was recorded telling his team to fight against those protesting like they fought Iraqi forces in the 1980s. If the government of a nation is fighting its own people, this is a sign that something needs to change. A government should be caring for the people living in the nation and I think that it reflects poorly on their leaders as indicators that they are not using their power properly. Organizations, such as Iran Human Rights are reporting the government for this misuse of power to attack citizens. So far, 76 protestors are being reported dead across 14 different provinces in the region.</p>
    
    <p>Thinking about the freedom of choice that is a part of the protests reminds me of the overturning of Roe vs. Wade in the United States. I believe that anyone should have the ability to choose what is done to their body or how they decided to present themselves. I think culture creates additional nuances with this stance, however, I believe that exist ways for traditional cultural values to coexist with modern practices and values. People should be given the choice to practice their own culture and should not be required to practice the culture of those in power.</p>

    <p>This past weekend I went to the 2<sup>nd</sup> annual Norman Brewtoberfest with some friends. This was a fun opportunity where I got to experience a different community in Norman than I am usually surrounded by. There were food trucks, different vendors, breweries, and a live band playing music. I felt nothing but love from this festival as it celebrated Bavarian culture.</p>
    
    <p>Brewtoberfest is a play on Oktoberfest, a German festival celebrating their culture. Although Brewtoberfest in Norman is only a single event, Oktoberfest is 16-18 days depending on the year. Annually this festival begins in mid-September and lasts until the first Sunday of October. The origins of this festival come from a wedding between Bavaria’s Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen in 1810.</p>
    
    <p>I didn’t realize that Norman celebrated Oktoberfest in any way and was happy to hear about this event. Although this is not a part of my heritage, I love being able to participate in shared cultural traditions where I can. Gaining a better understanding of other cultures and why they are important is a way that I gain different perspectives of the world. Different communities on campus share their culture through different events and they get students involved to experience these opportunities. I feel like it is more difficult to engage with events like this when you’re off campus, so I love that the Norman community is investing in culture.</p>

    <p>I recently attended the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) Showcase. Each of the organizations that performed put so much time and effort into their performances. The purpose of this event was to show off each of the multicultural Greek organizations for others to see during their recruitment season.</p>
    
    <p>Many of the acts used strolling, which is a tradition that started in African American Greek life in the early 1900s. Strolling combines song and dancing in a line to represent pride for your organization. Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black Greek sorority, is accredited with starting the tradition in Greek life, however, there is debate on who exactly it originated from.</p>
    
    <p>Although strolling originated within the African American community, it has grown to encompass more of multicultural Greek life. Some National Panhellenic Council (NPHC) Greek organizations led the way for other multicultural Greek organizations to exist, such as in the Latin and Asian communities. This is the reason many of their organizations practice strolling and can showcase it at events, such as our MGC Showcase each year.</p>
    
    <p>Despite this uplifting tradition that is meant to show pride, there is debate on the ethics of those with non-African heritage practicing this tradition. Culturally, it is argued that this tradition belongs to the African American community and should not be practiced by anyone else. This would effectively stop many of the multicultural fraternities and sororities to stop practicing as well.</p>
    
    <p>Identity and culture are two complex topics to unravel. Everyone shares multiple interwoven identities that contribute to their multi-dimensional culture. I feel like sometimes this can be overlooked and other pieces of identity can be forgotten. A question that I think of is, does strolling remain an African American tradition if it is practiced by many different communities? Is there a different tradition that the Latin and Asian communities can practice that gives respect to strolling, but is something different? I don’t know these answers, but think they are worth exploring.</p>

    <p>Life is about the memories that we make from our experiences. The last half of our study abroad program was just as eventful as the first and proved to be the perfect way to start the summer. One weekend we visited Cinque Terre, a collection of 5 towns along the coast. We were in Vernazza for a day and had the most marvelous time at the beach. The water was clear and the buildings vibrant.</p>
    
    <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-523 size-medium forMobile300" src="http://cpnewkirk.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Snapchat-936419383-300x225.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    
    <p> Part of the program involved corporate visits. The first visit we went on was to Carpigiani, a gelato machine manufacturer. While there, we got to see how gelato is made using their machines and got to taste some afterward. This visit included a tour of the production line. Each of us was impacted by seeing real engineers working on the floor to improve processes for something as fun as gelato.</p>
    
    <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-521 size-medium forMobile225" src="http://cpnewkirk.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220609_172149-225x300.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    
    <p>Towards the end of our time in Arezzo, the entire program took a pasta-making course. We made ravioli and tagliatelle under the guidance of the in-house chef, Fabio. This was an amazing experience that was built into the program for students. After the class, we cleaned up everything and ate what we created!</p>
    
    <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-520 size-medium forMobile300" src="http://cpnewkirk.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220613_121330-300x225.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    
    <p>Completing our final project presentations for our class was relieving and what better way to celebrate than traveling across Italy. The program took a trip to Sorrento for two days, one of which was spent as a day trip to the island of Capri. On Capri, I hiked to the top with our dean and had a glorious view of the sea. Others took a boat trip to the blue grotto and got to swim.</p>
    
    <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-519 size-medium forMobile225" src="http://cpnewkirk.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Snapchat-407189992-225x300.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    
    <p>The final night in Sorrento was bittersweet as we relaxed on the rooftop overlooking the sunset. It was an amazing time and a phenomenal way to end our program. We were off to Rome for our last night and were able to have one last meal together before each of us hopped on our flights back to the United States. I learned so much about myself and made new best friends on this trip and am so thankful for this experience.</p>`,

    <p>Studying abroad on the engineering program in Italy has already been so rewarding and we are only one and a half weeks into the four-week program. Staying in Rome the first few days was so incredible. We’ve been immersing ourselves in Italian and can fully order in Italian now and know our way around the cities we’ve been visiting. After the ten-hour flight, we visited the Trevi Fountain where we threw in coins as part of the legend that if you throw one coin: you will return to Rome. If you throw two coins: you will fall in love with an attractive Italian. If you throw three coins: you will marry the person that you met.</p>
    
    <p><img class="wp-image-512 size-medium aligncenter forMobile225" src="http://cpnewkirk.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/281640196_353506040207687_2177041533430939776_n-225x300.jpg" alt=""  /></p>
    
    <p>Next on the list was the Colosseum, Forum, and Pantheon. This was a packed day, and we were exhausted by the end of it. My favorite was the Colosseum because of how interesting it was to here about how they used it and the engineering behind the architecture. Each of the other places were just as breathtaking with their art. The last few stops in Rome were the Vatican Museum and Saint Peter’s Basilica. It was incredible to see the Sistine Chapel in person.</p>
    
    <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-510 size-medium forMobile300" src="http://cpnewkirk.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/280373312_515682663593904_8733215157463547145_n-300x225.jpg" alt=""   /></p>
    
    <p>I can’t wait to visit Rome again, but now we’re off to Arezzo to start class and experience the OU in Arezzo campus. Arezzo is a small town comparable to the size of Norman, Oklahoma. While here, we’ve done lots of shopping and exploring while looking for new places to eat and relax. One of my favorite places is the Medici fortress park. We’ve had a picnic there one night and plan to relax there more. I can’t fail to mention the beach trip we took one weekend to Viareggio. The Mediterranean Sea was so cold, but it felt so amazing. There was jellyfish in the water with us.</p>
    
    <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-511 size-medium forMobile300" src="http://cpnewkirk.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/280462972_5100387926683706_4327218665900868378_n-300x225.jpg" alt=""  /></p>
    
    <p>This past week we took a trip to Florence to visit the Baptistry, Cathedral Museum, Museo Galileo, and Brunelleschi’s Dome. Climbing the dome was my favorite part. It was incredibly high up but getting to the top was so worth it. One of the most amazing experiences while we were here.</p>`,

    <p>Just before Spring Break, I had the opportunity to attend the Regional Leadership Development Conference with our Oklahoma chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. During this conference, we were able to network with other chapter members across our region, which includes Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. We were able to come together and take pride in our Hispanic heritage. It is important to have spaces like these to celebrate each other and provide resources and opportunities that benefit students.</p>
    
    <p>While at the conference, we attended many sessions devoted to leadership and professional development. One that I attended had Boeing professionals talking about work-life balance and challenges that they faced throughout their careers. Another session discussed authenticity in the workplace and how to carry yourself into your career. There was also a career fair for all attendees with companies like Google, Intel, P&amp;G, and Nucor. While at the fair, I had the opportunity to discuss the graduate school programs that TAMU, NYU, and SMU have in their colleges of engineering. This was a valuable experience to hear about what programs they offer and what initiatives they are executing to retain their students.</p>
    
    <p>By the end of the conference, some of my takeaways were that you can be authentic in the workplace while adapting to a different lifestyle. For example, one of our national board members shared an experience of how he was almost fired just because he didn't understand the work culture in his place of work. He shared with us his experience of adapting his work attitude, but still holding what he felt was an important part of him. This proved to be valuable advice.</p>`,

    <p>In the second webinar in a series offered by the College of International Studies, the history behind the Russian Invasion of Ukraine was presented and discussed. Something that I had not thought about before is the multiethnic background of the Ukrainian people. The name Ukraine was a name given to the territory by Russia as it was created, and the name means "frontier". Both Russia and Ukraine can be traced back to the Kievan Rus region in the 11<sup>th</sup> century, proving that their origins are intertwined. These similar histories meant that Russians, Poles, and Jews are some of the ethnic groups that make up the demographics of Ukraine.</p>
    
    <p>Despite these common origins and ethnic groups, the unification of Ukraine and Russia was not voluntary. Propaganda was created to create an image of unification between the citizens of both countries. This was a way of promoting the “Russian world”, a post-imperial and supranational perspective meaning Russia should dominate certain cultural settings.</p>
    
    <p>Putin wants to establish a buffer with the west. He wants respect as a great power and sees himself as a savior to Russia. Part of his legacy is taking what was given to him when he began the presidency and making Russia an empire again by rebuilding its power. He claims that the greatest tragedy of the 20<sup>th</sup> century was the collapse of the Soviet Union. From his perspective, capturing Ukraine would show that Russia is an empire again and secure the legacy he is after. It is believed that he is acting now because he feels threatened about the growing democracy in Ukraine as well as the established military.</p>

    <p>Last Thursday I had the opportunity to hear from some professors about the Russia-Ukraine War. Each of the professors on the panel have experience with this subject matter either through personal background or through study. We began by discussing how these two countries got to this situation over the past few decades. Dr.Chenetsky kicked us off by taking about the clash of empirical and national identity that Russia currently has. Dr.Goode brought up how it is still a question as to what Russia is if not an empire after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Putin leverages feelings about the identity of Russia to legitimize his regime. Some ways he does so is through foreign policy and by capitalizing on the memory of Russia being a superpower. The annexation of Crimea and though more autocratic and institutionalized claims are examples of what has driven Russia to this war. Putin put Russia in a corner where he can’t back down due to this identity he has created.</p>
    
    <p>Some of the contributing factors that are now driving Putin were brought up by Dr.Chapman. Because of the limited scope of political opposition in Russia, Putin has been able to turn to legacy projects through his regime. Any political opposition is decimated and there is no one to oppose him. This has made him increasingly more isolated, leading to incorrect assumptions about how Ukraine and the world would react to this war. The Ukrainian democracy is well on its way to developing into a successful government that values decentralization as a way of reform. The power is going to the regions in a way that people feel is good and empowering to citizens.</p>

     <p>This past week I was able to attend a talk hosted by the Out 4 Undergrad organization in partnership with The Centre for Global Inclusion. Out 4 Undergrad helps high-achieving LGBTQ+ undergraduates reach their full potential, and The Centre for Global Inclusion serves as a resource for research and education for individuals and organizations in their quest to improve diversity and inclusion practices around the world.</p>
    
     <p>Francesco Carbolante has over 10 years of experience as VP of Engineering at Qualcomm in France and many accolades in engineering management over research and development. He addressed how artificial intelligence can be used as a tool that contributes to more diverse and inclusive workplaces. The bias built into artificial intelligence is also addressed as a concern for the fate of diversity and inclusion.</p>
    
     <p><img class="size-full wp-image-488 aligncenter forMobile300" src="http://cpnewkirk.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1535501639177.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    
     <p>Technological evolution effects society exponentially, for example, the way computers have shaped the workplace during COVID or how the internet connects the globe. This evolution is speeding up and the rate of computers evolving is increasing. Although technology can be a positive thing, it can cause more damage than benefit. This is going to be more intelligence in everyday appliance but that does not mean it can do what we want. Despite this intelligence, it is important to think critically and not believe anything a computer says.</p>
    
     <p>Using artificial intelligence becomes more challenging when a problem is subjective. Although computer science may be thought of as based in fact, machine learning can be unethical and cheat. Machine learning works based on patters and is guided to decisions using logic. This method of development has constantly upgraded models looking at live data. New algorithms are looking at resumes, however there can be bias introduced in the utility function. This function is what defines solutions. Ethics consequences and different value systems across cultures create unsuitable artificial intelligences.</p>
    
     <p>Fairness must be defined mathematically in machine learning, however this is difficult when biases data sets, biased motives, and inaccurate data sampling are introduced into the system. It is important for companies to have committees with many different backgrounds to contribute and approve systems that use artificial intelligence to ensure it is being used properly.</p>`,

     <p>Dr.Jayati Ghosh recently presented on campus to speak on global climate responsibility. I was able to attend this talk on Zoom and learn more about the inequality seen in environmental spaces.</p>
    
     <p>Currently, carbon emissions are largely measured by looking at the energy produced in a country, rather than the energy consumed by a country. This underplays the significance of consumption in the Global North because of the imported energy brought to these regions. These measurements are used to blame countries, such as India and China, on the global realm by emphasizing negative data points that are not truly reflective of energy usage. The United States and European Union combined makeup 62% of global cumulative carbon emissions from 1850 to 2011. This portrays the inequality from country to country because both the United States and European Union have power across the globe and are established in the Global North. Looking at the relationship of power and energy consumption, is it possible to rank countries on a scale that considers both the level of development a country has and its energy consumption?</p>
    
     <p>Another important point brought up during the talk was the inequality within a country. This can be seen when analyzing data from the bottom 50%, middle 40%, and top 10%. As income is increased, the impact of emissions increases as well. How would the trend change when looking at the quality-of-life vs emissions? Are these directly related?</p>

     <p>The United States has finally ceased involvement with the war taking place in Afghanistan. Withdrawing from war will always be a complex issue for any participating party. President Biden claims that it was the best decision when looking at the alternative. The alternative he describes involves being forever stuck in the endless cycle of war overseas with ground troops being deployed. Many of Biden’s critics claim that the US could have evacuated sooner or more orderly than they did. Additionally, some say that the only option was to escalate the war. Regardless of what could have been, the reality is that the US is no longer present in Afghanistan, and we are seeing the aftermath of that play out.</p>
    
     <p>After almost 4 months since the Taliban had seized power in America’s place, we are seeing mass starvation threaten the population. It is estimated that one million children will die as a result. This estimate is larger than the total number of Afghan citizens estimated to have been killed directly from the war. The government and economy have collapsed from lack of western aid and the Taliban does not support citizens. A drought unlike any before is affecting the region as well, leading to below-average wheat harvests.</p>
    
     <p>This humanitarian crisis has been accelerated due to the coronavirus pandemic, conflict, and climate-related shocks. Some barriers preventing western aid are in the sanctions placed to prevent the Taliban from gaining world power. While these policies are made so as to not recognize the legitimacy of the Taliban, they also prevent aid from being delivered to Afghanistan. Aid takes the form of food, money, and medicine that is not available locally. The US is working on solutions to granting more funding to this humanitarian crisis, however, millions of Afghan citizens are suffering every day.</p>

     <p>Reclycling plastic is critical to the health of our planet. Coastal nations are the source of 8 million tons of plastic waste that escape into the ocean every year. This is equal to setting five full garbage bags on every foot of coasline across the world. Kenya's capitol, Nairobi, generates 2,400 tons of solid waste each day, with 20% being plastic. This large amount of waste production has led to the degradation of the city. Less than 50% of this plastic is recycled, however the goal set by the National Environment Management Authority is 80%.</p>
    
     <p>A Kenyan woman named Nzambi Matee is determined to change this statistic. Matee is the founder of Gjenge Makers Ltd, which makes affordable and recycled building materials for Nairobi. She began with a prototype in 2018 and in 2020 has entered the market with pavers. Pavers are flooring that are commonly used for driveways, roads, and sidewalks. These recycled units have been well received by the city. They outshine mud, concrete, and gravel in durability and beauty. Not only this, but Matee was successfully able to market them at a price affordable to the local community.</p>
    
     <p>Matee's goal is to promote sustainable communities and cities. Her material is sourced from post-industry waste and consumer recyclers. This keeps the plastic out of the environment and repurposes it for a purpose.</p>
    
     <p>One of the largest challenges for Matee was being a woman in this space. The construction industry is heavily male dominated and proved to be a strong adversity. One of her largest challenges today is scaling her company up to produce more of an impact. Their capacity cannot meet the demand and they could use more space and equipment. Currently she is working on finding solution to this while running a sustainable business model for her employees.</p>

     <p>Lebanon is in a humanitarian catastrophe. The country's society has taken hit after hit. Their economy, government, and infrastructure have collapsed and are in desperate need of help in the middle of a pandemic.</p>
    
     <p>Lebanon was a success story of the middle east in the 1990s. After their civil war ended, the country was united and has a flourishing economy. The government decided to tie their currency directly to the American dollar as a way to provide stability, however, this only lasted for a few decades. In 2011 Syria broke out into a civil war and this greatly affected the economy in Lebanon. Because their currency was tied to the American dollar, tourism and international appeal were also linked to their economy. This means that a neighboring civil war would negatively affect the banks. To combat this, the national bank wanted to create an incentive to deposit American dollars by offering great interest rates. This proved to be less than perfect when the banks needed more money to pay for the interest rates. It wasn't until 2019 when people were no longer able to get money out of their banks and the economy started to suffer. Throw in the 2020 COVID pandemic and the economy was destroyed.</p>
    
     <p>Additionally, there was a bombing in August of 2020 in the capital of Beirut. This brought greater national stress and concern. With this bombing, Lebanon has gone through multiple prime ministers who have not successfully restructured the government in a way that will support its citizens. Lebanon citizens are currently experiencing shortages of bottled water, electricity, gas, cooking oil, bread, anything and everything considered a necessity of everyday modern life.</p>

     <p>This past Wednesday I was able to attend the monthly Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers meeting. At this meeting, we went over some upcoming events and applications for the remainder of the semester. Coming up we have a national convention that will be in Orlando, Florida. SHPE's purpose is to promote Hispanics in STEM, so this event is oriented towards professional development and community building. There are many workshops and activities planned that our chapter will participate in, including regional meetings where we get to network with other chapters.</p>
    
     <p>The activity for this general body meeting was creating papel picado. This is a tradition in Mexico that celebrates holidays like the Day of the Dead or even Christmas. Papel picado is generally made from tissue paper, however, this practice dates back to the Aztecs when they would decorate slices of tree bark using rubber and paint. These decorations were used on shrines and places of cultural significance.</p>
    
     <p>This cultural art grew in popularity in the 1970s, as it spread to Mexico City. Before then, this was largely believed to have originated in the state of Puebla. Papel de China came before papel picado and was transported when Puebla was still a Spanish colony. This contributed to the creation of papel picado and led to its rise in the late 20th century. The paper decorations were declared a piece of the national heritage of Puebla in September of 1998.</p>

     <p>I had the privilege to attend a discussion on the archeoastronomy of the Incan empire with Steven Gulberg.</p>
    
     <p>Steven Gullberg is Lead Faculty for the College of Professional and Continuing Studies' School of Integrative and Cultural Studies at the University of Oklahoma. Gullberg does research in archaeoastronomy. He serves as the University of Oklahoma's Director for Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture. He also serves as chair of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture.</p>
    
     <p>In his talk, he discussed ethnoastronomy. Ethnoastronomy looks at the astronomical systems of indigenous people. The study of ethnoastronomy combines anthropology and astronomy and can use data taken from other fields as well to create a better idea of the culture of indigenous peoples.</p>
    
     <p>Solstices and equinoxes had large impacts on culture. It determined agriculture and religious practices because solar orientations were such a large part of the Andean mythology and creation. The Incas worshipped the sun as their deity and saw their emperor as the direct descendant of the sun. The led to their proclamation of being children of the sun.</p>
    
     <p>Cultures preceding the Inca include the Huari, Nasca, and Chavin. These cultures contributed to who the Inca were and how their culture operated but did not last long enough to develop advanced social structures, astronomy, or religion. The knowledge of the Inca came from both conquering other tribes as well as discoveries on their own.</p>
    
     <p>The Inca as a whole was the largest empire ever known to exist in the Americas. The emperor Pachacuti and his descendants ruled over 4800 kilometers from Chile to Columbia. Throughout their empire, they had armies and fortress to protect and conquer. This system required roads and infrastructure, such as storehouses for transport. This speaks to the advancement of their society.</p>

     <p>This was a very informational talk about the ingenuity of African countries and African peoples. The speaker was Dr. Michael Ralph, an Associate Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis from New York University.</p>

     <p>He prompted us by asking about China's role in Africa and setting the context of Black Lives Matter in the US. One of the articles he cited described Black Lives Matter as "uplift[ing] Black joy and liberation, not just Black death." Dr. Ralph explained that African countries, China, and the Black Lives Matter movement might seem distinct and separate, however, each of these describes an exploited continent and group of people that have faced a large struggle for justice. Each of these domains promotes a common question, what does it mean to be treated as an object or to be alienated?</p>
    
     <p>Dr. Ralph claims that we need to shift the conversation away from the kinds of exploitation surrounding the African continent and people and onto expertise and ingenuity that African people have cultivated and leveraged. His first argument is that oppressed people will cultivate expertise and his second claim is that expertise becomes a part of the ingenuity that transforms conditions.</p>
    
     <p>What is expertise and who decides it?</p>
    
     <p>Expertise shapes political and economic possibilities. Senegal is used as an example of this because of their fight against terrorism and the way they have cultivated a renowned reputation. I think it's interesting that they only use their military for humanitarian missions, compared to the United States where we are always in a war. Often active militaries are associated with political instability, (which is a threat to democracy) but Senegal has become a democratic exemplar in Africa.</p>
    
     <p>Senegal has managed to secure and maintain this standing through elaborate diplomatic negotiations. In 1487, the Senegalese ruler rode to Portugal asking for assistance in a conflict. The Portuguese ruler asked them to convert to catholicism and they agreed. African and European sovereigns have cultivated this expertise over centuries through economics and political relationships. This story shows that the African people have not always been oppressed or exploited, which is a critical part of history to keep in mind. Some countries choose to become autonomous to avoid coercion, while some countries see collaboration as an opportunity to grow expertise.</p>

     <p>The SHPE Regional Leadership Development Conference began on the 18th and ended on the 20th. This is usually done somewhere in our SHPE region, however, this year it is on Zoom and combined with region 7. This has created a unique opportunity to get to know other SHPE members from region 7, a geographical region we are not usually paired with.</p>
    
     <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-359 size-large" src="http://cpnewkirk.oucreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-5.06.39-PM-1024x547.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
    
     <p>This was such a great conference because of the networking opportunities it offered with peers across the southeastern United States and companies across the nation. There were many companies there that were recruiting and hosting different sessions. Some of my favorite sessions on day one were "It's All About Networking", "Effective Team Development", and "Emotional Intelligence". My biggest takeaway from the networking session was that it's going to be awkward talking to people at first. Talking to new people and trying to establish a connection, be that a peer or recruiter, might not feel natural. A lot of team development deals with making a connection with your teammates and building trust. The speaker talked about the four Es of team development, something similar to <a href="https://www.ideafit.com/uncategorized/four-es-building-great-team/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20be%20better,%2C%20equipping%2C%20encouragement%20and%20evaluation.">this</a>. I really got a lot out of it and feel like a better leader because of it. The emotional intelligence session was something I needed to hear. They discussed taking a step back from a problem and evaluating your response when you have a cool head.</p>

     <p>On the second day of the conference, there were some more workshops and the career fair. I did not attend the career fair because I have an internship already planned and have done networking prior. Attending the morning sessions and supporting my fellow SHPE members was very rewarding though and I got a lot out of this conference. My highlight workshop has to be "Power of Communication" because they discussed different ways you can engage in active listening to ensure you are clearly communicating to others. Their example was simple, giving someone directions, but these methods can be applied to real engineering projects or even in everyday conversation.</p>
    
     <p>On the last day I attended a few more of the workshops and got the most out of the "Transformational Leadership" session. In it, they talked about how to promote change to others and empower your teammates to achieve greater things. There were many takeaways that I can bring back to OU.</p>

     <p>This past Thursday I had the opportunity to attend the Newman Prize Symposium where I had the privilege of hearing presentations on contemporary Chinese literature by Yan Lianke. The presentations were made by different professors from across the nation about the works of Lianke. The Newman Prize is a biennial award that recognizes the "outstanding achievement in prose or poetry that best captures the human condition, and is conferred solely on the basis of literary merit." Below is a paragraph from their website that states the mission of this award. <a href="https://www.ou.edu/cis/sponsored_programs/institute-for-us-china-issues/cultural-issues/newman-prize-for-chinese-literature">Linked</a> is the symposium home website.</p>

    <blockquote>The Newman Prize for Chinese Literature is part of the <a href="https://www.ou.edu/cis/sponsored_programs/institute-for-us-china-issues.html" target="_self">Institute for US-China Issues</a> mission to advance mutual trust in US-China relations. Literature and other cultural products can promote understanding through their celebration of our common humanity. The Newman Prize honors Harold J. and Ruth Newman, whose generous endowment for a <a href="https://www.ou.edu/cis/sponsored_programs/institute-for-us-china-issues/harold-j----ruth-newman-chair-in-us-china-issues.html" target="_self">chair</a> at the University of Oklahoma enabled the creation of the OU Institute for US-China Issues.</blockquote>

     <p>While this isn't a topic that I am familiar with, it has been so educational. As an engineer, I don't often analyze works of literature, however, I enjoyed partaking in this event. One of the things that I learned about was the AIDS epidemic in China. There are not many accounts of this epidemic aside from a few articles and personal memoirs from Dr.Gao Yaojie, an AIDS activist that lives in China and has actually been under house arrest from the Chinese government due to her activism. The AIDS epidemic was a plot point in Lianke's book <em>Dream of Ding Village</em>, which is about the blood sales in rural Henan province that sparked a major AIDS crisis in China. This book was banned in China due to its sensitive topic in a state-driven censorship system. Lianke is known to self-censor to ensure his books get published, however, this is a situation where it backfired. In the case of <em>Dream of Ding Village,</em> the book got banned anyway.</p>
    
     <p>Lianke has been introduced as China's most banned author when he travels abroad but does not take pride in being banned. He argues that there is no inherent value in being banned. The reality of integrating China means that he naturally runs into this issue.</p>
    
     <p>Another aspect of Lianke's style is his self-described "mythorealism", which means that his works are folklore-esque with timeless characters (Fisher). I find this writing style very intriguing and it makes me want to read his works.</p>
    
     <p>There was a great Q&amp;A at the end that discussed the topics of capitalist modernity and his criticisms of China's take on it. Much of this went right over my head, but Carlos Rojas also discussed his role in translating the novels. Concerning the covers, he doesn't see them, only translates them. The British cover to <em>The Four Books</em> is"the Four Books" and the American version is "THE FOUR BOOKS". This is likely due to cultural perceptions of the cover and can be chalked up to differences in artistic license. The publication process has an extensive back and fourth in the US with the author, but in China that is not the case. An editor might correct for some typos, but not much beyond that. Rojas tries to be faithful to the originals, while there are some people that would make adjustments to the structure. If Rojas notices continuity issues he tries to go back to Lianke and find compromises that keep the original intent.</p>

     <p>Two days ago a white gunman fatally shot eight people. Six of them were Asian women.</p>
    
     <p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Asian American community has been experiencing increased amounts of hate crimes and racism. It has been <a href="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.69.231/a1w.90d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210312-Stop-AAPI-Hate-National-Report-.pdf">reported</a> by the "Stop Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Hate" group that there have been at least 3,795 reported incidents of hate against Asian American and Pacific Islanders since the early days of the pandemic (Ramachandran).</p>
    
     <p>There are many things we can do to support the Asian community at this time. Below are some action items from the Asian Americans Advocating Justice (AAAJ) group. This is far from exhaustive and there are so many more ways you can help advocate for social justice. I encourage you to read through the articles linked at the end of my post to find more resources.</p>
    <ul>
       <li><a href="http://bit.ly/GeorgiaAAPICommunityStatement">Sign</a> their collective community statement</li>
       <li><a href="https://bit.ly/DonateToGeorgiaAAPICommunity">Donate</a> to the Atlanta victims and their families</li>
       <li><a href="https://bit.ly/georgiaAAPIcommunitycare">Share</a> resources you can offer to the victims, their families and other community members like language translation, mental health services, legal services, childcare or food assistance.</li>
    </ul>

     <p>During this time it is important to check in with your Asian American peers and check that they are alright. Also, recognize that everyone's experiences are diverse and our communities are not defined by one experience. <a href="https://www.advancingjustice-aajc.org/">Linked</a> is the AAAJ website that has more information on getting involved.</p>
    
     <p>There has been an uptick in racism towards the Asian community due to COVID but this is hardly a new issue. Racism has painted America since before its founding (Brockell).</p>
    
     <p>In 1854 the California Supreme Court passed <strong>People v. Hall</strong> ruling that people of Asian descent could not testify against a White person in court. This endorsed racism and let Whites literally get away with murder, in the case of George Hall. Hall shot a Chinese immigrant, Ling Sing, and the witness testimony was rejected because they were Asian.</p>
    
     <p>The <strong>Chinese massacre of 1871</strong> occurred in Las Angeles after a White man was killed in the crossfire of different Chinese groups. This led to rioting from over 500 White and Hispanic rioters who attacked the Chinese community specifically and lynched at least 17 Chinese men and boys. None of the rioters ever received punishment.</p>
    
     <p>During <strong>World War II</strong>, the Japanese people living in America were forced into <strong>internment camps</strong> by the U.S. government because they "might aid the enemy". These camps were inhumane and no spies were ever found. Reparations were made in 1988 with a presidential apology and $20,000, although they are owed much more.</p>
    
     <p>During the <strong>aftermath of 9/11</strong> hate crimes were on the rise towards Muslims and those perceived as Muslim. Often times this included people of South Asian descent. Just four days after the terrorist attack, aircraft mechanic Frank Silva Roque murdered Balbir Singh Sodhi, whom Roque mistook for Muslim.</p>
    
     <p>There is so much more information on the racism towards Asians in America, but this is all I will be covering for today.</p>

    body: `<p>The IAC International Pageant is a competition where candidates get a chance to showcase their talent and be chosen as the face of OU international. The winners will get the chance to promote their platforms as the face of OU International. Winners are judged on three parts, a talent portion, their platform, and a Q&amp;A. I knew two of the three judges, Matthew Cancio and my friend Wambui. This year, the talent portion was done via pre-recorded video. Additionally, votes are cast by the audience and factored into each candidate's final score.</p>

     <p>There was so much talent, most of which was dancing, but there were also soccer tricks. In total, there were six contestants from different countries and it was so awesome to hear each talk about their experience and backgrounds. This was such a fun time and a great way to get to know the international community at OU. Their platforms were often about social justice surrounding issues that are present in their home countries. Each candidate has a deep connection with their cultures and I was honored that they chose to share it through the pageant. One way they shared this was through their clothing (as seen in the pictures below.)</p>
    
     <p>When it came down to announce the winners, there was a voting calculation error but it was handled well. At first, the wrong winners were announced, but the IAC president promptly apologized and the emcees were able to keep us entertained for the correct winners to be announced. The third judge also had amazing comments to share about the hard work that each candidate put into their experience and how each of them is destined for greatness.</p>

     <p>Alongside the COVID-19 pandemic comes the rise of digital vaccination passports. This is an idea that is now moving towards reality with many airlines and even countries to ensure those traveling have proper documentation. Providing vaccination documentation is not new and or COVID-19 specific. In the past countries have required vaccination documentation of yellow fever, rubella, and cholera, to name a few examples (Felter). Imagine tapping your phone to a scanner and the airline receptionist receives all of your vaccinations. This would streamline some safety measures.</p>
    
     <p>The main issue is developing an app that can be used globally and protect the user's privacy. Some companies and groups are working through IBM's blockchain technology to use different kinds of data (Mzezewa). Many of the functional apps right now are used in a single airline or for events in public locations. Eventually, this will need to expand to encompass the globe.</p>
    
     <p>There are many countries that are requiring travelers to test negative for the virus in order to be let in. Creating a user-friendly vaccination passport would lead to a boom in the tourism industry for these countries. Streamlining the regulations from country to country would make travel easier and safer.</p>
    
     <p>There are three scenarios of credentials for COVID-19; immunity certificates, negative tests, and vaccination records. The first is unlikely, however, the last two are already being used.</p>
    
     <p>In the end, it will take many years to update any of our global systems. The current passport system took 50 years to install. The digital vaccine passports also raise the problem of inequality. If you lack the proper documentation then you are getting left behind in the world. When creating new ways to connect the planet, we need to consider the challenges that it raises for all kinds of people. We also need to consider the vaccine distribution on a global scale. The supply is limited and this is causing countries to compete and fight. Even with the vaccine, there are so many variants of the virus that there is no telling who can become infected.</p>

     <p>This past week I had the privilege to digitally attend the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers National Convention. At this convention, I was able to attend informational sessions on topics ranging from grad school to career advice to what diversity and inclusion mean in the workplace.</p>
    
     <p>The SHPE National Convention serves as the country’s largest, annual gathering of Hispanic STEM students and professionals. This year there were 8,964 total attendees. The convention is actually divided into five conferences from Pre-College for high school students to Professionals in STEM for early professionals with special conferences designated for Latinas and for those interested specifically in technology and innovation. Attendees are welcome to create their own schedule depending on their interests, which is what I love so much about this event.</p>
    
     <p>This was so great to experience even with it being online. I truly valued my time being able to be with my friends through this convention and got so much out of this. I watched many of the sessions and plan to watch more on-demand through a service that SHPE National will be offering at a later date. These are available until the next convention so I have plenty of time to utilize these resources and take notes.</p>
    
     <p>Two of my favorite sessions were the one on "Effective Communication for Engineers" and the one on "Emotional Intelligence VS Technical Ability". The former discussed what it means to be communicating with teammates as an engineer and how crucial it is to be clear as well as the importance of active listening. Good communication has to go both ways to reach success. The former session was really interesting when hearing about different perspectives from people in the industry talking about how many bad experiences they've had with people that have low emotional intelligence. They gave great tips, like walking away from conflict if it is proving to be a problem.</p>`,

     <p>The SACNAS National Diversity in STEM conference was such an amazing experience this past week. It is the largest multicultural and multidisciplinary STEM diversity event in the United States and is hosted annually by the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics &amp; Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). The 2020 event marked the first-ever virtual conference and the 5th record-breaking conference in a row.</p>
    
     <p>At the conference this year there were 5,767 total attendees, with a 10.1% growth compared to 2019, and 1,981 were first-generation college students (including me)! At the conference, there were 930 research presentations, 117 programmed sessions, and 346 institutions and companies. Needless to say, it was a very rewarding opportunity that I am very proud to have been a part of.</p>
    
     <p>This conference was full of speakers and networking opportunities. Before I get into my favorite speakers, I want to shoutout the amazing musical performance done by the native band on each day of the conference. Their transition music was not only beautiful but also set the mood to learn the most I could from this event. My two favorite speakers were Brandon Ogbunu and Alonso Martinez.</p>
    
     <p>Brandon Ogbunu is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University. He is a computational biologist whose research investigates modern questions in epidemiology, population genetics, and disease ecology. During his talk, Ogbunu discusses the importance of diversity and inclusion. He talked about fighting as an activist and overcoming barriers to reach a better society.</p>
    
     <p>Alonso Martinez is a Senior Lead Technical Artist at Google AI and is working on next-generation interactive/social characters. Previously he was a Modeler / Rigger in the Character Department for Pixar Animation Studios and has worked on 6 feature films including Academy award-winning films: “Up”, “Inside Out” and “Coco”. Martinez discussed imposter syndrome throughout his career and how he has overcome that. His advice was to surround yourself with others that are where you want to be and to take things one step at a time. If you don't know something, ask for help.</p>

    title: "Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Symposium",
    body: `<p>This past weekend I was able to digitally attend the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Research Symposium. This experience was created to give minorities in STEM more opportunities to learn and present research.</p>

     <p>OK-LSAMP is a consortium of Oklahoma colleges and universities working together to develop programs aimed at increasing the number of students from under-represented populations who receive degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Some of the current goals and activities of OK-LSAMP focus on undergraduate research experiences, graduate school preparation, and international experiences. These opportunities are what interested me in applying to be a scholar.</p>
    
     <p>There is much history behind LSAMP. In 1992, the Oklahoma State Regents organized the Oklahoma Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (OKAMP SEM). Dr. Earl Mitchell, Oklahoma State University (OSU) Professor, was chosen to serve as Chair of the Alliance. In 1993, Dr. Mitchell, with the help of Dr. Ann Ackerman from South Oklahoma City Junior College, wrote and submitted an AMP proposal to the National Science Foundation (NSF). Included in the proposal was additional matching support for the program at the regional universities provided by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. In 1994, OSU, as the lead institution, along with seven partner institutions was awarded the grant. The OK LAMP program was established to address the critical undersupply of minority students pursuing BS degrees in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (SMET).</p>
    
     <p>Throughout the 2019-2020 academic year, the Oklahoma Alliance increased the number of scholars to 280 from 267 in the 18-19 academic year. Of those 280 Scholars, 84 completed Bachelor of Science degrees, and 30 of the 84 graduates were admitted to graduate programs, a total of 35% of the scholars. During the 2019-2020 academic year, 149 (53%) of the Alliance scholars participated in research activities, and 26 of the scholars participated in international research experiences at 23 locations. Due to COVID-19, the spring semester affected our scholar's research, international experiences, conference presentations, and internships. Despite the cancelation of many activities, OK-LSAMP worked with scholars to ensure they were able to acquire experiences that would allow them to be prepared and competitive for graduate school.</p>

    title: "Presidential Debate and Pandemic Responses",
    body: `<p>The presidential debate was this past week and it provoked deeper thought into our international affairs. The debate itself was a mess and should have been treated much more formally than it was. This election has much more than just the presidency riding on it. It will determine the economy, healthcare, hopefully the supreme court appointment, how the pandemic will be handled further, foreign policy, climate change, and countless other things. The United States has been starkly divided politically these past few years and has turned many non-political issues into heated topics. Equal rights should not be political, a pandemic should not be political, the right to control one’s own body should not be political. I do not understand how some people can have such disregard for others.</p>

     <p>I wondered how other countries were doing during this time and the contrast with the United States is evident. Taiwan was able to use contact tracing and mobile Sim-tracking to make sure people were quarantining. They have a single-payer healthcare system, medical briefings for the public daily, and were even able to keep businesses open by using aggressive precautionary measures like taking temperatures and providing sanitizer before patrons could enter. In Singapore, the government gave out multiple and sizeable stimulus packages and had built up a deep financial reserve over the years. Its central bank was able to fortify the economic response by sharply easing monetary policies.</p>
    
     <p>In my opinion, New Zealand has handled the pandemic beautifully. Their first case was detected on Feb 28th, and they wasted no time shutting down the country. It took them less than three weeks for the country to shut its borders to outside travelers, and a week later instituted a “level 4 lockdown”. This means people could only interact with others that lived within their home to eliminate the virus altogether. New Zealanders have praised their government’s early response and coordinated messaging. In April, 88 percent of New Zealander’s said that they trust their government in handling the pandemic. Their prime minister has even promised that no one would lose their residence if they lost work, has begun creating tax reforms to assist small businesses and took a 20 percent cut to her salaries.</p>

    title: "Multicultural Greek Council Showcase 2020",
    body: `<p>The Multicultural Greek Showcase this year was amazing (as always)! It began with the emcees getting audience hype and throughout the program, each of the MGC greek organizations would have time to make any announcements and perform. For many of these organizations, they would stroll, others showed a video of their members dancing. Although the Zoom presentation was not perfect, I enjoyed my time watching it on my laptop. There was limited in-person seating available in the Forum building south of the dorms. Seeing different cultures expressed and represented at this event was a great experience and always inspires me year after year. I have even gotten to see some of my friends perform with their Greek life. It is truly amazing to see them all strolling with pride and enthusiasm for their brothers and sisters around them. The energy is unmatched.</p>

     <p>Strolling is a representation of the bond that each of the members has. This symbol has African roots and is often accredited to the Alpha Kappa Alphas from the 1920s. Strolling is much more than a simple dance. The members come together and display their unity, culture, community, and love for each other. Although many MGC organizations stroll to display these qualities, the culture does not belong to all of them and it is important to acknowledge where this practice came from. Stepping and strolling were essential in displaying African culture to racist institutions and were an education part of crossing a line.</p>

    body: `<p>This past weekend I attended the National Institute for Leadership Advancement conference and it was such an incredible opportunity. I participated as the community service chair for our local chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). I was given the opportunity to meet other officers in SHPE from around the United States who are working on amazing programs and projects in their regions. This networking experience helped me form bonds with fellow chapters and student leaders.</p>

     <p>NILA is an annual experience designed specifically for training SHPE chapter leaders. Like any learning and advancement, you will only get out of this experience what you put into it. I treated NILA as a launching pad for growing my leadership capabilities and a way to network with others. The concepts, exercises, and tools I developed during NILA are meant to be revisited, practiced, and applied. Something that I learned a lot about was the importance of reflection on leadership and revisiting these different skills. We were mailed Chapter Leader’s Workbooks that were developed and created to serve as a reference and to outline our ideas and questions and write down best practices and notes to ourselves to revisit through our term as a chapter leader.</p>
    
     <p>One of the sessions discussed what it means to be a mentor and how to get the most out of that relationship. I benefited from this greatly and plan on taking this advice to heart. Over the past year I had a mentor but did not drive the relationship by reaching out and asking questions. Something that we were taught was that mentorship should be driven by the mentee.</p>

    title: "ICE Policies – July",
    body: `<p>On July 6<sup>th</sup>, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempted to encore a policy where international students taking online classes must either transfer to an institution where in-person courses are offered or they must depart the U.S if OU moves to online-only instruction at any point during the Fall semester.</p>

     <p>This brought forth many feelings from the OU community. Our friends were being told they could no longer participate in the same education as us and this information was coming from our own government. Many of us felt that this was unjust, wrong, and inappropriate because there was no reason behind it.</p>
    
     <p>As an OU student, I will not stand by while our international peers are subjected to xenophobic practices. As a campus, we strive to provide an inclusive and diverse environment for our peers and, therefore, should condemn the policies put forth by ICE. All students deserve to be welcomed with open arms to the OU community and our university should be wholly committed to protecting our international students as a result. I urge the OU administration to fully protect our international students through the pandemic and beyond.</p>
    
     <p>Thankfully our university was able to take some action and join the lawsuit proposed by MIT and Harvard alongside other institutions as well. On July 8<sup>th</sup> our administration and College of International Studies released a statement supporting our international students. Later, on July 14<sup>th</sup> ICE would rescind its awful policy, reverting back to the previous regulations.</p>

    body: `<p>The Coronavirus has plagued a hundred thousand people's lives and affected millions more indirectly. Although this is a worldwide outbreak, it does not yet meet the criteria for a pandemic, according to the World Health Organization. This virus is believed to have begin in a fish market in Wuhan, China where it jumped from animals to humans. Viruses that do this do not usually transmit as efficiently through humans as this novel virus does. The number of people infected in China has plateaued, hopefully being a sign that things are looking better. There are government officials around the world that are infected, and so many people. Although symptoms can be as little as a cold, it can be deadly for the elderly, young children, or people with underlying health conditions. Plans abroad are being impacted; OU has already put any trips to Italy over the summer on hold and brought back all students in Italy for their safety. Most trips are currently still scheduled, but with daily updates anything could happen.</p>

     <p>Soap and hand sanitizer are being sold out worldwide. The best way to protect oneself is by washing your hands with soap and water for a full 20 seconds. This should effectively kill all harmful pathogens that would be on someone’s hands. A cure is not expected to be discovered and tested for a few more months. Staying calm amidst this crisis is crucial.</p>

The event that triggered this sit-in is a history teacher using the n-word while in class, however this is not the first incident of the use of a racial slur on campus. Incidents have plagued the University of Oklahoma ever since its founding, but the more recent cases begin in 2015 with the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity singing a racist chant on a bus. (<a href="http://www.oudaily.com/news/timeline-a-look-at-racist-incidents-on-ou-s-campus/article_b3e6522a-58db-11ea-a74b-c31c3e6ae337.html">http://www.oudaily.com/news/timeline-a-look-at-racist-incidents-on-ou-s-campus/article_b3e6522a-58db-11ea-a74b-c31c3e6ae337.html</a>) The organization was removed from campus and was under investigation on a national level. Since then there have been numerous incidents of students and faculty using racial slurs or accepting racist actions. The purpose of the sit-in is to work together with the administration to create a plan that will actually promote a more diverse and inclusive environment on campus.</p>

     <p>The OU Daily came up with 4 takeaways that describe the ending of the sit-in. (<a href="http://www.oudaily.com/news/ou-evans-hall-sit-in-takeaways-from-bert-s-agreement/article_773340e2-5a87-11ea-827b-bbe0f52e3ccb.html">http://www.oudaily.com/news/ou-evans-hall-sit-in-takeaways-from-bert-s-agreement/article_773340e2-5a87-11ea-827b-bbe0f52e3ccb.html</a>) This first of which involves how Provost Harper will remain in his position. BERT demanded that the provost be fired, however administration did not honor that demand. This was resolved by the agreement that a student advisory committee will be created to serve alongside the provost. Much else of what BERT had demanded will become a part of OU’s strategic plan that interim President Harroz has been working on in his time as President. BERT will be meeting with administration every two weeks to ensure progress is being made. Some of these decisions and actions will depend on how the Oklahoma Board of Regents react. One thing is for sure, there will be much more action happening at OU and less apology emails.</p>`,

Because of their reproduction rate, married couples also prayed to them for children.” There is a myth that “the Jade Emperor said the order would be decided by the order in which they arrived to his party.

    title: "Climate Change Strike",
    body: `<p>Climate strikes are organized on campus by the Student Environmental Coalition. These are so important for campus because of the light it shines on a long-term problem. Climate change is happening due to centuries of human manipulation of the environment and it could take even longer to revert back to its original state. The solution to this issue lies with the younger generations and it is so crucial that it is brought to the forefront of college students minds.</p>

     <p>Recycling and cutting down on individual carbon footprints are a great start on a personal level. This, however, will not fix global warming unless corporations decide to make a difference. If more companies reduced their waste and made the effort to shift consumerism, society would be in a much better place. Consumerism on a global scale is a large part of this problem. Buying and discarding is a toxic cycle that must be broken to stop climate change in its tracks.</p>
    
     <p>Simply halting climate change would not be enough. Steps must be made to reverse the effects of a rising ocean, changing pH, temperatures that are changing. To change this, new scientific discoveries have to be made. New legislation must be put in place. Public policy has the power to change our projected future. Regulating factories and creating an expectation that the environment is a valuable part of our planet is something that needs to be discussed more. Holding climate strike events on campus is a perfect step towards this goal.</p>`,

    title: "International Human Trafficking",
    body: `<p>As mentioned in a previous post, I was in Puebla, Mexico for a two-week study abroad program. During this program, we learned about human trafficking and how it affects the Americas. There were many resources that we learned about and we discussed the definition of human trafficking. It is defined by the act, means and purpose. One of the laws in particular that we focused on is the Palermo Protocol that was adapted by the United Nations in 2000. It is three separate laws that serve to prevent, suppress, and punish human trafficking.</p>

     <p>Human trafficking is a large issue in Puebla, due to the Puebla-Tlaxcala corridor. These two states are connected to each other and are located in central Mexico; a perfect location for traffickers. This is a destination, source, and transit area. Despite the knowledge and scale of the problem, the government suffers from impunity where people that are charged do not get sentenced.</p>
    
     <p>Often times the victims of these acts are not aware that they are victims. They can be trafficked by family or friends; people that they trust. There are children who traffic their siblings. To stop this problem, the demand needs to be cut. Children need to be raised with values to break the cycle. The children of trafficked adults are considered secondary victims. Even though the situations are terrible and unhealthy, victims sometimes decide to go back after receiving help. Help can come in the form of transition houses or safe houses, where they are kept away from their traffickers.</p>`,

    body: `<p>The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers national conference is coming up at the end of October. This is a conference that gives members of SHPE a chance to develop professionally. Their focus is people of Latinx background, however all are welcome.</p>

     <p>The conference has professional speakers from the industry, a career fair, professional development activities, and lots of networking opportunities. It is all around a great time that truly supports Latinx involvement in engineering.</p>
    
     <p>Having the mission to not only support but develop Hispanics truly benefits the world. This culture contributes to diversity, as do all, and would be at a loss if not for this organization and conference. Our local SHPE chapter sends about 30 people to this event and many end up with internships and job offers as a direct result. This means that SHPE is effectively reaching their goal and accomplishing so much in the Latinx community.</p>
    
     <p>Being a part of this group of people has been so inspiring. Seeing people who really care and support one another truly gives me hope for the world. Witnessing the love that they feel for one another shows me how they accomplish so much for their members. Every meeting is devoted to benefiting their members in some way, whether it’s resume critique or a guest speaker on how to succeed at the career fair. They always keep the end goal in mind. I truly feel great being a part of this group and being around others that contribute so much to society.</p>`,

    title: "#MeToo Movement",
    body: `<p>I recently went to a MeToo panel with the Theatre Multicultural Committee. The MeToo movement is a global movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault. The panel I attended focused specifically on the acting industry. There were speakers from the fine arts college, as well as some active in the industry.</p>

     <p>They began by introducing themselves and explaining what they do. Then they started to discuss some prepared questions. The first question was about MeToo in media. It was said that the industry’s eyes are fully open and that they are working on stopping sexual harassment. The next question was about how actors handle that intimacy that is seen on screen. In order to have that intimacy, they look in the script to find what drives the character as well as discuss boundaries with the other actor. It is a conversation and each actor must be strong about what they feel comfortable with.</p>
    
     <p>A very problematic idea in this industry is the “casting couch”. When it happens, it comes from a power that one has over the actor or actress. It has been normalized to blame the actor or actress, however it is not their fault. The term sexual harassment was coined in the 1970’s, although it has always existed. Sexual harassment includes gender discrimination and pronoun misuse.</p>
    
     <p>When working with others, getting a verbal consent is necessary. Having friends that are there to support you are strong motivators. Even in MeToo, there are some lacking areas. It is still difficult for women of color, in particular, to stand up due to their intersectionality. Even negotiating pay is difficult, because of society’s preconceived notions about how employees should behave.</p>

    body: `<p>My friend Giovanna held an event called BrazOU to celebrate the Brazilian culture on campus. Her family is from São Paulo and treasures takes this with pride. It brought together many friends of hers that can all relate by their similar background. There was karaoke, poetry, food, and so many experiences of life in Brazil. Being able to hear others talk about growing up in a different country is truly magical.</p>

     <p>Seeing the passion people have for where they are from shows how important it is to recognize other backgrounds. It can be so lonely to feel surrounded by people that can not relate to you or understand your own experiences. It is alienating. Finding a community on campus, or even in the community, can provide the emotional support to continue your education, career, or even your life. The importance of these events, and organizations that plan these events, is unmatched. They create a diverse and inclusive environment for our students. This means they can be themselves on campus without fear of being hurt or harmed in any way.</p>
    
     <p>Supporting these inclusive environments is so important for our campus to grow and develop alongside the world. Without events like these, we would remain stagnant and foster outdated ways of thinking, views, and opinions. Simply attending this event gave me a global perspective on culture and contributed to my friend’s point-of-view of the University of Oklahoma. Her time at this university should be so special and she should feel so celebrated for coming here.</p>`,

    <figcaption>Us on top of the Temple of the Sun with the Temple of the Moon in the background</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Leaving Puebla, we first spent a day and night in La Preciosita. This is a women empowering village that hosts groups of people for a period. This is a source of income and helps encourage their people to stay in Mexico. It was so much fun to be able to play with the kids and meet the people that lived there. We spent the night in host homes and it was incredible to live with them for ever a short period of time. After leaving the village the next day we went to Teotihuacán, where the Temple of the Sun and Moon are. Some of us climbed to the top and it was so much fun! I loved climbing the Temple of the Sun because it was so tall, and we could go to the very top! The Temple of the Moon was blocked off half way up, because it wasn’t safe. Learning about the history of Mexico and what was preserved from the Aztecs was so fascinating. The pyramids built in this part of the world are built in layers and are flat on top, not pointed. Each layer of the pyramid is added on after about 52 years and we were able to see that at the ruins next to the temples. After that we went to our hotel, City Express EBC on Reforma. It was right across from Reforma 222 which is a really nice mall. The second day that we were in Mexico City we went to the Museo Memoria y Tolerancia, which was about societal tolerance. 7 Different genocides were discussed, the main of which was the Holocaust. The last half of the museum discussed diversity and why it is important. On our last full day, we went to the US Embassy and learned about what a foreign service officer does. It was so interesting to hear everything from them. They even were open about how they felt about the wall that our President always talks about. I am interested in being a foreign service officer, however the track to get there is very long and I am not sure if I want to do it that bad. They also discussed the Fulbright Program, which I am also interested in. The water and air quality around Puebla and Mexico City are terrible due to the active volcano that separates the two. I would like to do research that pinpoints a solution to this issue. To end our last night, we went to El Lugar del Mariachi, a mariachi restaurant and danced the night away. That next morning, we woke up at 3am for our flights back to the states.</p>

    <figcaption>Our trip to the mall in Puebla</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>My time in Puebla was so phenomenal! We stayed in the JF Occidental hotel when we were there for a little more than a week. Armando works for OU I believe, and he was our trip planner. He handled everything from paying for food to scheduling our tours. There were many tours and churches that we got to see. Our first speaker was a professor at the Ibero-americana University. There she discussed human trafficking. Some points that stuck with me were that 41% of all Mexicans trafficked into the United States originate from Puebla; impunity is common in Mexico, which means that many criminals are actually charged with their crimes and sentenced; femicide is when crimes are committed against women because they are women. Her discussion was enlightening in that many of us did not know of these issues before hand. Later that day we went to a restaurant called Mi Ciudad and had dinner. It was so nice and high quality! Another of our activities was a tour of the historic center in Puebla. We saw the main cathedral and the 1<sup>st</sup> library in America.</p>

    <figcaption>Our trip to ANTHUS</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>A highlight of mine while in Puebla was going to ANTHUS and meeting Marian Wenzel. She leads human trafficking safehouse and transition house in Puebla. It was so humbling to hear her story and life. She has been to Australia, Europe, and the Americas and went on a cruise ship that’s purpose was to serve others. She eventually realized what her passion was and began ANTHUS. Their Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/ANTHUS_AC">@ANTHUS_AC</a> and you can find their website by searching for “ANTHUS Mexico”. Something that I learned there was how Puebla is a destination, source, and transit country for trafficking. That means that people are from there, brought to there, and moved through there. Puebla comes in 5<sup>th</sup> for human trafficking worldwide. Out of the 11 safehouses in Mexico, ANTHUS is the model and sets the bar for others. One of our next activities was visiting Cholula’s Museum and Pyramids. Cholula is a beautiful town next to Puebla and contains the largest pyramid in the world, by volume not height. The pyramid is buried under a hill due to the years of abandonment and is in ruins. Some of it has been reconstructed, however it is unlikely that the entire site will be excavated as there is a church on the very top of the hill. Another activity was visiting the Fort of the Battle of Puebla, the true reason for Cinco de Mayo. A common misconception is that the 5<sup>th</sup> of May is Mexican independence, however it was the first battle won by the Mexicans in their revolution. The fort overlooks all of Puebla and was placed there for protection. We visited many museums about the many revolutions as well and many churches. One of my favorite locations was the Parián Market that we got to shop at! It was full of artisan goods and was so much fun to browse and negotiate a price for the items. One of the last things that we did in Puebla was listen to a speaker from the Instituto Nacional Migración. She came to talk to us on behalf of the government and it was fascinating to learn about immigration from the other side of the border.</p>`,

    <p>Today was Global Engagement Day and I got to attend the 3rd session about the Fulbright Scholarship and Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) Program. Each of these were very exciting opportunities that I look forward to applying to in the future. I'll apply for Fulbright at the end of my Junior year and the beginning of my Senior year and plan on doing research or an independent study of some sort to utilize my engineering background. An initial thought I had was to record data on the Great Barrier Reef and find a way to restore it to its state before human consequences started affecting it. The CLS program is over the course of a summer and I plan on applying to it this upcoming school year. I’m considering learning Hindi or Chinese as a way to further my own ability to communicate with those in the engineering industry.</p>
    
    <p>There were two speakers at the session who have experienced the CLS program and one that is accepted as a Fulbright. The speaker that studied Arabic in Oman seemed so genuine and amazing as a person. Her experience got me excited to apply and develop my personal growth to be more inclusive and worldlier. When I study abroad, be it with OU or through another program, I want more to the experience than just credit hours or lots of spare time. I want to meet people that are from an entirely different culture than my own to provide me with a new perspective of the world. I want to better myself and America by going abroad.</p>`,

    <p>HASA held an event in the Molly Shi Ballroom this afternoon that promoted Latino culture. There were traditional food different Latin countries and people sang song in Spanish. I had a blast attending this event and eating foods that reminded me of home. I personally enjoyed the elote and tamales, but there was such a large variety of foods and quite a talented singer so most anyone could find something that they liked. It was truly incredible to see all of the HASA volunteers executing such a large event with many moving parts. Their planning has brought many cultures to the forefront of campus life and created a much more inclusive environment for Latinx on campus.</p>
    
    <p>Promoting diversity on campus is necessary to move the campus towards a more diverse state. By attending this event, students will have a broader perspective on Earth and more experiences that they can see from others. Many of these perspectives come from different countries and con create a more coherent image of our campus. Displaying our own diversities and differences will create an environment that is closer to a unified mind-set than the present. This feeling of unity on campus will not come overnight, but it must be worked on and progressed through events on campus and more learning opportunities concerning diversity. Discarding the stigma around talking about race, culture, or even class in public will contribute towards this goal. Participating in other cultures and experiences without a doubt benefit campus life amongst students.</p>`,

Me^2 is a mentoring program that comes out of the Diversity and Inclusion office in the College of Engineering. As a part of this program, I have a mentor that helps me in regards to more than just academics. He is there for me when I need him and can help in mere moment’s notice. The bowling night was organized by the graduate assistant in the office and had a good turnout.</p>
    
    <p><br />Being a part of the Diversity and Inclusion office has been such a blessing. They have shown me the importance of diversity on campus and why we need to fight for the continuation of programs that support this idea. By being an advocate for what we believe in, we can make a difference in the world. Coming into college I had felt alone, but going through the AT&amp;T Summer Bridge Program that the Diversity and Inclusion office organizes gave me the resources and the positive mindset needed to take on college without a worry.</p>
    
    <p><br />It is through this their support that I have been inspired to help others to the best of my ability. I want to assist others in their venture through college and give the incoming Freshmen a hand when they get here. It is a scary transition, and if you look or act different it can only be more difficult. Embracing diversity and identifying as a unique individual based on your culture and ideals is what makes an education worth having.</p>`,

In the darkness however, BSA has proven to be a relevant student organization that positively benefits the entire campus. It is apparent that there needs to be a change in culture in the community. No student should have to worry about their rights when attending higher education. Many argue in defense of what happened and against what happened, but at the end of the day there is still a problem. This should not be left to be discussed later but be addressed and resolved.</p>

    <p>The tension felt on campus from the rest of the world is extremely apparent. Earlier today there was a helicopter, presumably from a news station, that was hovering above campus.

    <p>This academic year I am participating in the University College mentoring program with RC Davis, a renowned professor on campus. His mentor group has the goal to help Latinx students adapt to campus life with his help. This has proven to be a brilliant program that not only assists students academically through the resources RC offers, but it has also developed new friendships and networking among the students. I have personally met many new people and have greatly benefited from this program.</p>
    
    <p>RC has connections to the multicultural Greek life and has encouraged all of us to investigate those groups. His influence on campus is quite apparent in that he is a leader in the Latino community. He not only is a figure head for the Latinx population, however, but has assisted his students in any number of ways. He offers his assistance to us and makes connections from university life to problems larger than ourselves. His ability to pull discussion from us is phenomenal. In his office we often have full discussions regarding the state of politics on a global scale, gender equality, and modern literature to name a few topics.</p>
    <p>Through this program I have met peers from across the globe. Their experiences have been worlds away from my own. Meeting students that are my age have my interests, act like me, communicate like me, are almost my twin, yet they have a significantly more worries than me in that they can't see their family every weekend like I can.

    title: "Fast Fashion with an International Perspective",
    body: `<p>The Earth is deteriorating at an alarming rate. One may suspect the transportation industry or perhaps the mining industry to be the sole culprits of pollution to our planet, however the textile industry is the third leading industry in pollution today. This is largely due to the fast fashion that we experience as a part of our current culture.</p>

     <p>Fast fashion is the antithesis of traditional fashion. The difference between the two is that traditionally there were two seasons of clothing put out into stores across the world, but now there are close to 50 seasons. Some of this can be attributed to the development and underdevelopment of countries. Clothing brands such as H&amp;M, Forever 21, Old Navy, and even Target, outsource their clothes and use labor from outside of the United States, because it is cheaper and saves the consumer money. This sounds good in theory; jobs are provided to third-world countries, laborers are getting paid more money than they would be otherwise, the consumer saves money, and there is more profit. While these all contribute to why textile factories are largely located anywhere from Bangladesh to Guatemala, they have negative consequences.</p>
    
     <p>The collapse of Rana Plaza is a significant example of this. In Bangladesh 2013, the Rana Plaza building collapsed, killing just over 1,000 people. The majority of these people were the factory workers that were not allowed to leave their jobs. Further, the demographics of these workers were mostly women. It is not just Rana Plaza that has fatal working conditions with little to no remorse from the factory owners, this is happening everywhere. It is unfortunate how difficult it is to change the current culture to cut out these toxic conditions, however it will be done. The need for more activists in environmental sustainability and human rights is clear. By purchasing more clothes from locally sourced locations, we can be the change that will change the world.</p>
    
     <p>For further reading, here are some articles I used in my quick research. I encourage you to do more research on your own for Rana Plaza and Fast Fashion, as there is so much knowledge to gain on the Fashion Revolution.</p>

     <p>Celebrating our ancestors that have left this world is such an important aspect of the latino culture. The Disney movie 'Coco' is takes this and creates a fun film that kids can enjoy.

     <p>When I was there, they had a dancing competition as well as team chants. It was so much fun to watch and help out where I could! This camp is aimed towards High School Jrs and Seniors of Latin descent to help encourage high education in the latin community.

     <p>Participating in this organization helped show me how much of an impact we are capable of having on others. Not only Hispanic populations, but even first-generation students, or students from a lower economic class than many others. These kids did not have the same opportunities as other students may have and need all of the encouragement they can get. Seeing their culture bring them all together is proof of how important diversity is at the University of Oklahoma. Regardless of where these kids decide to go to college, it can be said that they left LWB with a positive outlook on higher education. I had conversations with many of the kids about what they want to do when they grow up and they had a pretty firm grasp already on what majors are and what interested them. This was very impressive to me, because my High School did not have any programs such as these to get kids acclimated to college.</p>`,

That first or second week some of my friends were discussing a showcase they were going to go to. I wasn't interested in Greek life personally, but the event piqued my interest. I decided to go and it was SUCH a good idea! I had a blast that night and got to see some amazing performances from the multicultural fraternities and sororities. They were outstanding in their dances. One that stood out to me was the Native American tribal dancing. There was a large drum and one of their leaders wore traditional clothing from their tribe. The entire experience was really eye-opening to see that there are so many cultures present on campus.</p><p>It is events like this that really show me the value that the University of Oklahoma places on diversity. Some people think that diversity is beneath them, or that diversity is just a word that politicians made up. Having a diverse campus, community, and lifestyle is so much more than simply recognizing the existence of other cultures. It's about embracing the differences among us and lifting each other up. Sharing what makes us different and respecting those differences even through adversity demonstrate the fundamental values seen on this campus. It is without a doubt an honor to attend every event that brings together many cultures. Learning about others is how I will become a better individual by respecting the core believes of others.</p>`,

I'd be lying if I said I didn't have my doubts, but it turned out stupendous for all of the groups. Each bridge had its strengths and weaknesses. One even held a gallon of Hawaiian punch plus six water bottles. Afterwards we took a fun group picture.</p><p>This past time we made a skyscraper out of marshmallows and spaghetti. This was just as successful as te first activity. We time the kids on the activities to show them that deadlines are everywhere in engineering and real experience. Experiencing this exposure to engineering is expected to have positive impacts on these kids. My high school did not have anyone from a college or university speak to us on a regular basis, nor was there apparent alumni outreach like there is through this SHPE Jr chapter. I hope to make truly impact the community in a positive way so that my new friends are encouraged to attend a higher level of education than high school.</p>`,
