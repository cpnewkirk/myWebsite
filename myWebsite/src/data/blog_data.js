This event is a play on words for Cinco de Mayo, which is a celebration of the Battle of Puebla.</p><p>It was on May 5, 1862 when Mexico’s army won over France during the Franco-Mexican War. The Mexican state of Puebla has much pride in this victory because of its location, however, this holiday is not celebrated widely in the rest of Mexico. Traditions can include parades, recreations of the battle, and other festivities, although for many this is any other day.</p><p>Our event included a salsa competition that members could enter to showcase their best salsa. We also had icebreakers with facts about Mexico that people might not know. Some examples below:</p><ul><li>Mexico Is Where You’ll Find The Oldest University In North America</li><li>Mexico Is Home To One Of The Six Cradles Of Civilization</li><li>Mexican Silver Pesos Were The First Global Currency</li><li>All Beaches In Mexico Are Public</li></ul><p>There is a common misconception about Mexican Independence Day and Cinco de Mayo. Mexican Independence Day is on Sept 16<sup>th</sup> and celebrates the anniversary of the revolutionary priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla’s famous “Grito de Dolores”. This was a declaration of war against the Spanish colonial government in 1810 and now marks the first day of Hispanic Heritage Month.</p><p>Many of our SHPE members have family from Mexico and therefore put more value on Mexican Independence Day, but Cinco de Mayo is still an expression of our heritage. When planning this event, we look for ways to share that heritage with others to raise awareness about Mexican history.</p><p><img src="https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTYzNzEyOTI0OTM2ODQwNjE5/battle-of-puebla-gettyimages-527771091.jpg" alt="How Cinco de Mayo Helped Prevent a Confederate Victory in the Civil War - HISTORY" /></p><p>The background behind the holiday is very impactful in Mexican history. Benito Juárez was elected president of Mexico in 1861 but had to deal with the fallout of many poor financial decisions leftover by years of internal strife. France, Britain, and Spain came to Mexico to collect the debt Mexico owed them. While Britain and Spain were able to negotiate an agreement, France decided to seek even more and declared war to expand the French empire into Mexico.</p><p>The Battle of Puebla took place at Puebla de Los Angeles on May 5, 1862 and was between 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez and 2,000 loyal men under Juárez. The Mexican men were outnumbered and poorly supplied, while the French troops had heavy artillery. Despite all of these disadvantages for the Mexican side, they managed to defend Puebla and lost less than 100 of their men while the French lost almost 500.</p><p>Although this didn’t end the war or do much to dissuade the French, this victory was a symbol of hope and bolstered the resistance movement. France finally withdrew in 1867 after the United States was able to support Mexico following the United States Civil War.</p><p>Click <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/cinco-de-mayo">here</a> or <a href="https://www.history.com/news/cinco-de-mayo-battle-puebla-civil-war">here</a> for more information about Cinco de Mayo and the Battle of Puebla.</p>`,

Having the opportunity to lead an 18-person leadership team and welcoming 9 first-year students into our First-Year Program has taught me so much about leadership and my own self.</p><p>I've learned how important it is to advocate for others. As president, I get a lot of the credit for the chapter being successful or even because I oversee projects that our team executes. This really isn’t fair, because our team works so hard to execute their vision and it is critical to our success that they get the credit they deserve. Our team is strong and has proven that they are resilient problem-solvers that are passionate about our community.</p><p>I felt empowered in this role because for the first time, my identity matters in a professional setting. In SHPE, identity is critical to our success as an engineer, and we work to support Hispanics in STEM by connecting identity to our careers. Our national convention supports 10,000 students and recruiters through workshops and a career fair that hires Hispanics in engineering.</p><p>Moving forward, I will continue my legacy by upholding the core values of resilience, familia, education, and service. These are SHPE’s guiding values and are important to uphold in our day-to-day lives. I’ve learned the important of being resilient through our engineering education curriculum and the challenges that life throws. Throughout my time at OU I’ve been surrounded by my own familia that supports me and lifts me up in times of need. The alumni and professionals that come back and speak to us have demonstrated the importance of our education. The service to our community is critical to uplifting and inspiring others to continue our legacies and to support those around us.</p><p>I was surprised by our ability to bring change and leave an impact. As president, I’ve connected alumni back to our chapter, met with the deans to discuss student funding, represented Oklahoma at our national convention, and reached students that I never would have met otherwise. All of these opportunities have been part of my legacy as a student at OU and I am proud of the work I’ve accomplished.</p><p>My perception of being a leader changed because I really learned about team work. In engineering group projects you might have a small team that works on a very technical problem, but in SHPE our team is almost 30 people now and all of our problems are complex social issues. This has been a welcoming challenge for me to figure out management for and I am determined to continue this work after I graduate.</p><p>Thank you for the memories, everyone. I’ll miss you all as I begin the next step of my journey.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-595 size-full" src="https://cpnewkirk.files.wordpress.com/2023/03/4161a-signature.png" alt="" width="500" height="150" /></p><p>Christian Newkirk</p><p>President, 2022-2023</p>`,

First, the conversation started with a focus on Brazil. The previous president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, fled to the United States after the next president was elected and I was surprised to learn that he has an expired visa. I thought it was interesting when one of the speakers shared that the political unrest in Brazil did not develop overnight, but has been building since the mid-2010s. The people of Brazil were asking the military to through a coop when former president Bolsonaro lost his election. Thinking about the January 6th United States Capitol attack, it feels like a similar timeline.</p><p>Brazil experienced another political unrest event not too long ago. Former president Dilma Rousseff, the first female president in Brazil's history, was impeached in 2016, but what marks her impeachment different from the end of other political figures' terms is how she responded. Referencing my post on the Brazil Capitol Riot, we know that both former United States president Trump and Bolsonaro incited fear in their followers, leading to the attacks. Rousseff did not respond this way to her impeachment. Although there was much unrest, the political climate did not lead to an attack on the capital.</p><p>Next, the panel went into the cause of the current political crisis in Peru. Having Mexican heritage and growing up in Texas, my Latin American knowledge doesn't go very far beyond Mexico. Learning about Peru, I realized they have a similar history as the indigenous peoples of North America. When Spain colonized parts of South America, the Spanish elites benefited from taking advantage of the indigenous communities in the Andes. I was surprised by how similar our histories were and by how they affected the country over time.</p><p>Indigenismo is the movement in Latin America to advocate for their indigenous populations to have more power, however, their government began labeling the movement as terrorismo (terrorism). 2 million hectares of land was taken from haciendas (a large landed estate), but only 45 thousand have been returned to their communities. Conflict was on the rise from 1980-2000 and the government used extreme military tactics to eliminate the terrorists and any opposition that spoke out. Since then, the politics in Peru have been charged. I was shocked to discover this and had no idea that there was so much turmoil in Peru right now.</p><p>To learn more about the Peru political crisis, click <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-63971274">here</a>.</p>`,

    title: "What makes an Independence Day?",

    body: `<p><img src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4705866/National_Days_map2.jpg" alt="National_days_map2" width="100%" /></p><p>An Independence Day can be sacred to the citizens of a country. Independence represents freedom, government, and people.</p><p>The green countries in the image above celebrate a national independence day. Many of them were former European colonies and some in Eastern Europe became independent from the former Soviet Union. From this map, it is clear that European colonialism has impacted a major portion of our modern world. Although independence for the United States might be a centuries-old idea, in some places it is a much more present issue and holds much more personal meaning.</p><p>Not every celebration is just an independence day. France, for example, celebrates Bastille Day as their revolution. Modern revolutions only date back to the 1700s, with France, South Africa, Iran, and China being some key examples. The unification of a country is another common cause for these national holidays.</p><p>Some countries celebrate different days entirely. Thailand celebrates the king’s birthday, Spain celebrates Columbus Day, Portugal celebrates the death of a celebrated poet, and Greenland celebrates the longest day of the year. Each country has its own culture and values. National holidays are one way to see what is valued by a country but don’t always tell the full story. Columbus Day is controversial in Spain just as it is in the United States and isn’t reflective of national pride.</p><p>I feel inspired by how different groups of people can take the traumatic experience of colonialism and celebrate their ability to overcome that through revolution or their declaration of independence. Living in present-day America, I don't feel connected to our Independence Day beyond festivities and fireworks. It is fascinating to read about recent revolutions and fights for independence happing in the 21st century and see how it is impacting people today. Our ancestors fought for a brighter future in this country but our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world are fighting right now for freedom in territories across the world.</p><p>Something interesting that I found is that the United Kingdom and Denmark don’t have a national holiday like this. It's said that the United Kingdom doesn’t have one because it played the role of the colonizer in so many other countries. Something else that contributes to the lack of a holiday is that it isn’t a homogenous state like other countries might be. It is made up of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, four non-sovereign countries. This unification happened over many centuries, not in a quick revolution, making it difficult to make a holiday that the whole country could take pride in.</p><p>You can read more about how different countries celebrate independence <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/3/5867599/heres-a-map-of-other-countries-versions-of-4th-of-july">here</a>.</p>`,

(Photo by Sergio Lima / AFP) (Photo by SERGIO LIMA/AFP via Getty Images)[/caption]</p><p>The Brazilian government has experienced some trouble reminiscent of the January 6th United States Capitol attack. This parallels the political divide between the left and right parties in each respective country. Seeing these events happen multiple times within a few years of each other is very troubling and I feel this is evidence of a problem on the global stage.</p><p>Brazil recently had a presidential election in October of 2022. The two leading candidates were Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right incumbent, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is from the left wing and better known as Lula. Lula won this campaign on October 30th in a run-off election and was inaugurated on January 1st, 2023.</p><p>On January 8th, thousands of Bolsonaro's supporters stormed Brasília, the nation's capital, claiming the election was rigged. This included congress, the supreme court, and the presidential offices. Americans will feel all too familiar feelings reading about this because it is claimed that Bolsonaro incited the riots through social media and has been claiming that Brazilian elections could not be trusted for years.</p><p>Political parties are often blamed for this division and seen as the cause of the anger and aggression that results, however, I believe that the real source of these issues lies in leadership. During the riots in the United States and Brazil, the incumbent president was actively working to speak down on the government institutions in the country. As a student leader, I've learned that it is important to show that you trust the systems that you work in and that conveying the importance of what you do supports your team. Former United States president Donald Trump and Bolsonaro did not support their institutions of power and instead, framed themselves as the source of power in the country. Rather than building trust in their systems, they guided their constituents to trust only them.</p><p>I feel like this is not a good way to lead a country because it does not put constituents first. Overvaluing a single person takes away from the purpose of democracy and having elections. Even with my limited experience as a student leader, I have found that the team can accomplish much more if trust with the institution is built. When there is little trust in these systems, it leads to problems in communication, execution, and development that should support those you represent.</p><p class="ok_Wdg ch9NWA UPenfA RVfbug toHYKQ">By learning more about what is happening in Brazil, I learned that the issues we experience in the United States are present in many regions across the globe. It takes everyone from all backgrounds to work toward a brighter future for our planet. Although it is important to focus on domestic issues, I encourage everyone to research what is happening globally because everything impacts the world we live in.</p><p>Click <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-64206220">here</a> to learn more about the Brazil riots from BBC and click <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/world/americas/brazil-election-protests-bolsonaro.html">here</a> to learn more from New York Times.</p>`,
