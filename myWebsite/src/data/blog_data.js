This event is a play on words for Cinco de Mayo, which is a celebration of the Battle of Puebla.</p><p>It was on May 5, 1862 when Mexico’s army won over France during the Franco-Mexican War. The Mexican state of Puebla has much pride in this victory because of its location, however, this holiday is not celebrated widely in the rest of Mexico. Traditions can include parades, recreations of the battle, and other festivities, although for many this is any other day.</p><p>Our event included a salsa competition that members could enter to showcase their best salsa. We also had icebreakers with facts about Mexico that people might not know. Some examples below:</p><ul><li>Mexico Is Where You’ll Find The Oldest University In North America</li><li>Mexico Is Home To One Of The Six Cradles Of Civilization</li><li>Mexican Silver Pesos Were The First Global Currency</li><li>All Beaches In Mexico Are Public</li></ul><p>There is a common misconception about Mexican Independence Day and Cinco de Mayo. Mexican Independence Day is on Sept 16<sup>th</sup> and celebrates the anniversary of the revolutionary priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla’s famous “Grito de Dolores”. This was a declaration of war against the Spanish colonial government in 1810 and now marks the first day of Hispanic Heritage Month.</p><p>Many of our SHPE members have family from Mexico and therefore put more value on Mexican Independence Day, but Cinco de Mayo is still an expression of our heritage. When planning this event, we look for ways to share that heritage with others to raise awareness about Mexican history.</p><p><img src="https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTYzNzEyOTI0OTM2ODQwNjE5/battle-of-puebla-gettyimages-527771091.jpg" alt="How Cinco de Mayo Helped Prevent a Confederate Victory in the Civil War - HISTORY" /></p><p>The background behind the holiday is very impactful in Mexican history. Benito Juárez was elected president of Mexico in 1861 but had to deal with the fallout of many poor financial decisions leftover by years of internal strife. France, Britain, and Spain came to Mexico to collect the debt Mexico owed them. While Britain and Spain were able to negotiate an agreement, France decided to seek even more and declared war to expand the French empire into Mexico.</p><p>The Battle of Puebla took place at Puebla de Los Angeles on May 5, 1862 and was between 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez and 2,000 loyal men under Juárez. The Mexican men were outnumbered and poorly supplied, while the French troops had heavy artillery. Despite all of these disadvantages for the Mexican side, they managed to defend Puebla and lost less than 100 of their men while the French lost almost 500.</p><p>Although this didn’t end the war or do much to dissuade the French, this victory was a symbol of hope and bolstered the resistance movement. France finally withdrew in 1867 after the United States was able to support Mexico following the United States Civil War.</p><p>Click <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/cinco-de-mayo">here</a> or <a href="https://www.history.com/news/cinco-de-mayo-battle-puebla-civil-war">here</a> for more information about Cinco de Mayo and the Battle of Puebla.</p>`,
