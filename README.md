## Technologies Used

This project relies on React, CSS, and Javascript. I used Bootstrap, reactstrap and React-Bootstrap for styling. The blog posts were originally located on my blog for school and were exported as HTML text and converted for easy integration using the html-to-text package.

## Implementation

Firsts I laid out each component.

## Challenges

It was challenging

It was a new experience getting the navbar to work with Link.
