# Christian P. Newkirk

Welcome to my website repository and thank you for visiting. This website is somewhere you can get to know me, find my CV, and learn about what I've been up to in my blog that I likely won't update! Click [here](https://cpnewkirk.github.io/myWebsite/) to start exploring! This is optimized for most mobile devices as well.

To run this code locally, clone this repo, open it in your terminal, then run this code.

```
cd ./myWebsite
npm run dev
```

## Technologies Used

This project relies on React, CSS, and Javascript. I used Bootstrap, reactstrap and React-Bootstrap for styling. The blog posts were originally located on my blog for school and were exported as HTML text and converted for easy integration using the html-to-text package.

## Implementation

Firsts I laid out each component as  place to start building up the code. Then I started with the home page and worked my way down the navbar, populating pages as I went. About half-way through the project as my vision was growing, I worked on the styling to take a break from building out logic.

## Challenges

One of the most challenging pieces of this project was specificity of styles and getting each piece to do what I want. I learned a lot about optimizing a front-end application for other devices too by using @media in the css file. It was a new experience getting the navbar to work with Link.

## Future Work

I want to refactor the code to go over each item in the blog array and take every unique tag from all of the posts, then use those to create the filter.
